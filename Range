#work on ranges

#the rule of indexing applied in ranges
#indexing will be started from 0 (zero)

print(x[0]) #resulting number 1
print(x[5]) #resulting number 6
print(x[9]) #resulting number 10

print(x[10]) #turns to be an error, because it force to show 11-th elements
             #but, the ranges just consists of 10 elements
