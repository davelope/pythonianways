#what you can do on strings data type
# you can use ' ' or " " (single or double quotation marks will do the task)

#these 2 line of code will execute just correctly
print('Hello')
print("Hello")

#multiplying strings type of data
x = "Hello"
y = "World"

print(x*2) #this code will make Hello appear twice

print(x+y) #this code will make HelloWorld
print(x+" "+y) #this code will make Hello World #easier to read, right?

print("Hello" + 2) #this code will make an error, you can't adding or substracting strings by integer
